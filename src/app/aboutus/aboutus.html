   <h2>SiNON Therapeutics</h2>
   <p>

<strong>SiNON</strong> is dedicated to improving the lives of those who suffer from debilitating neurological diseases by increasing the ability of drugs to cross the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). Our patented Nano-Particle, the Carbon Dot, will enable pharmaceutical companies to encapsulate their drugs in a way which dramatically improves drug-localization to the brain. This allows for a reduction in overall dose administration to the patient, leading to reduced toxicity risk and side-effects while improving Therapeutic Index and cost-efficacy. Considering the rapid growth of the senior population, and subsequent increase in neurological disease, we believe that our novel technology is an essential part of the overall solution to this healthcare crisis in the US and around the World.

   <h2>HOW WE STAND OUT</h2>
   <p><strong>SiNON Therapeutics</strong> has developed a novel method of crossing the Blood Brain Barrier, which is effective, non-invasive, and most importantly can be utilized by almost all drugs (making even retroactive application possible).

   <h2>Our Solution</h2>
   <p>The <strong>Carbon Dot</strong>, is a Nano-particle made of the non-metal compound carbon. This complex Nano-particle is simply explained as a capsule, with a hollow core that can transport drug molecules, diagnostic markers, or almost any substance into the brain. One key aspect of the Carbon Dot is the ability to attach chemical functional groups to the surface of the capsule. Attaching different functional groups allows us to change the solubility, and therefore the rate of passage across the Blood Brain Barrier, of the Carbon Dot. Also, the more soluble Carbon Dots are easily excreted by the kidneys, which make this delivery system safe (It does not linger in the body). Different functional groups can also act as a “Zip Code” and target the Carbon Dot to specific areas of the brain.
