  <p>US Patent #12/719,791</p>
   <h2>Patents</h2>
   <p>The present invention relates to the water soluble self fluorescent Quantum Carbon Dots (C-Dots). These C-Dots are isolated from carbon soot in one embodiment a wax soot solvent washed and isolated from other larger material by filtration such as by membrane filtration. The C-Dots can be varied in their color by change of their size and by the amount of oxidative groupsâ€™ position on each C-Dot.</p>

   <h2>Starting Material Of Cdots</h2>
   <p>The Multi-Layers of the Carbon Nanotube .It has a inner chamber where drugs or genes can be encapsulated. also on the surface of the walls there are carboxylic groups that you Can do surface conjugations with specific receptors.
